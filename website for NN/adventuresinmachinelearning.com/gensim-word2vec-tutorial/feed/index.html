		<description><![CDATA[Hey, I ran into this problem as well at first. If you look back to when the model was created an option size=300 was added in :
model = word2vec.Word2Vec(sentences, iter=10, min_count=10, size=300, workers=4)
This 300 is the effectively the size of your model so when embedding the words your vector_dim has to be equal to 300 as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Andy!.
I saw your good tutorial.
I got one problem.

embedding_matrix = np.zeros((len(model.wv.vocab), vector_dim))

what does vector_dim mean?

I don&#039;t find about vector_dim Explanation.

Can you help me?

Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Andy, incredibly clear and concise tutorial. Was able to follow along without even running code to visual results.

I had some free time though and gave it a go to play around a bit.
I can&#039;t seem to get any results though when executing the model built with TensorFlow.

It&#039;s an error that name &#039;wv&#039; is not defined. It&#039;s picking it up after that first for statement during tf.Session().

Any idea what&#039;s wrong?
Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Andy! Great article! thanks for publishing. Btw why you are initializing:

`embedding_matrix = np.zeros((len(model.wv.vocab) + 1, vector_dim))` and not 
`embedding_matrix = np.zeros((len(model.wv.vocab), vector_dim))`. It doesnt seem there is a reason to add one more row.]]></description>
