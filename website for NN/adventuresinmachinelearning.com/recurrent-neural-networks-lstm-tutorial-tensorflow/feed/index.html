		<description><![CDATA[Hi Andy, I have the same question that Kumar asked before:
&#062; In the image ‚ÄúLSTM sample many-to-many classifier‚Äù, should the indices go from x0‚Ä¶x35, likewise h0‚Ä¶h35. In the current illustration, I do not understand why there is feedback within a batch (i.e., across rows ‚Äì which is of size 20)

Could you please help me on this? Thanks! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Andy,

Thank you for all the time you&#039;ve spent making these neural network tutorials, they have helped me a great deal. I have a question, though, that I haven&#039;t seen specifically answered anywhere and was wondering if you would be able to help.

Do you know if TensorFlow LSTMs can handle multiple datastreams at once? Working from your example, it would be like having 4 35x650 inputs at once, for a 20x4x35x650 input. I know I could convert 4x35x650 into 140x650 but I was wondering if there was a more elegant way to do this that would allow all four inputs to be considered at once instead of in some sort of sequential fashion.

Thanks for your time]]></description>

I will make an attempt on gpu also, so that when you post the update to this I can see how on track I was.]]></description>
