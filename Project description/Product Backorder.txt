Product Backorder predictions

Feb 2018 – May 2018

Project description
Predict Weather product will go on backorder or not – 
• The challenge was to determine the factors affecting product backorder using dimension deduction deduced irrelevent features and smoothing data to balance class variables using SMOTE(synthetic up and down sampling).
• Implemented a total 9 algorithm classification model to create predictive model.
• Understood the accuracy using Confusion matrix on test and K fold cross validation methods, out of with 4 models have given good accuracy.
	1. Random Forest
	2. SVM
	3. Neural Networks
	4. KNN
Accuracy Approximatly around 92%
Language used: R
